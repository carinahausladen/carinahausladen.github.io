After years of performing with various orchestras and ensembles, 
I had the honor of stepping into the spotlight as a soloist with a full orchestra for the very first time.

I performed Debussy's Danses sacrée et profane, a work that holds a special place in every professional harpist's repertoire. 
Originally composed for chromatic harp and orchestra, it was later adapted for the double-action pedal harp—yes, harps do have pedals! 
Though the piece is just 12 minutes long, navigating the pedal work was exhilarating.

*Navigating the stage during multiple rounds of applause is an art in itself. 
Here, you can see me glancing around, searching for help on what to do next.*

This experience was a dream come true. 
I’m deeply grateful to [Nota Bene](https://www.nota-bene.ch) for giving me this opportunity, and to Maestro [Jascha Von der Goltz](https://www.nota-bene.ch/orchester/dirigent.php) for his guidance. 
Working with a conductor who supports and encourages genuine artistic expression made all the difference.

*The Danses were composed for harp and string orchestra. I have performed with Nota Bene on many occasions before, and knowing the orchestra so well—along with their warmth and support—made the entire process incredibly enjoyable.*


A special shout-out to my talented colleague and friend, [Joshua C. Yang](https://scholar.google.ch/citations?user=4ryiNe8AAAAJ&hl=en), who captured the magic of this moment.

            This is how we brought home all the beautiful flowers. Luckily, the harp fits into the tram!
