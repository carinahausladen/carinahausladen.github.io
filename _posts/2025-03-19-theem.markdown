I am happy to have been invited to this year’s THEEM 2025. It was wonderful to reconnect with so many familiar faces. 
I had the chance to present my new paper, titled 

*Investigating Latent Intentions via Inverse Reinforcement Learning in Repeated Public Goods Games*. 

There’s no preprint available yet, but I’ll share an update once it’s out. 
In the meantime, feel free to reach out if you’re interested.
