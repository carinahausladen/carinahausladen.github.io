I had the pleasure of presenting our paper, "Social Perception of Faces in a Vision-Language Model," at the 2024 ESIF Economics and AI+ML Meeting held at Cornell University in Ithaca, NY.

The conference was incredibly engaging, with thought-provoking keynotes and a diverse lineup of presentations. 
I was fortunate to meet so many inspiring researchers, some of whom generously took the time to offer valuable advice for my upcoming job market applications.

A highlight of the trip was reconnecting with a friend I had spent a semester abroad with at Stanford back in 2017. 


Cornell is such an inspiring place!
