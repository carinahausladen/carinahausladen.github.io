Collective action is essential for addressing the grand challenges of our time. 
However, for such action to be successful, decision-making processes must be perceived as legitimate. 
In this study, we investigate the legitimacy of different voting methods.

*The participants voted upon 4 different questions via four different voting methods.*

Using a pre-registered human subject experiment, 120 participants cast their votes using four voting methods: majority voting, combined approval voting, range voting, and modified Borda count. 
These methods represent a range of preference elicitation designs, from low to high complexity and flexibility. 
Furthermore, we developed a legitimacy scale upon which the participants rate the voting methods.

The experiment was conducted in a non-political setting (voting on color preferences) and a political context (voting on COVID-19-related questions).
Our findings suggest that the perceived legitimacy of a voting method is context-dependent. 
Specifically, preferential voting methods are seen as more legitimate than majority voting in a political decision-making situation, but only for individuals with well-defined preferences.
Furthermore, preferential voting methods are more legitimate than majority voting in a highly polarized situation.

*The perceived legitimacy of a voting method varies by context.*
