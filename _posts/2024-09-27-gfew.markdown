It was wonderful to return to Cologne for the annual conference of the [Gesellschaft für experimentelle Wirtschaftsforschung](https://gfew.de/).  
This visit was especially meaningful to me, as the University of Cologne is my alma mater—I completed my PhD here between 2017 and 2020. 
Being back on campus brought back many wonderful memories.

The GfeW also holds a special place in my heart. 
Back in 2013, I received the Heinz Sauermann Prize for my Master’s thesis, which gave me the opportunity to conduct an experiment that sparked my passion for Behavioral Economics. 
Since then, I've been a member of the GfeW, but this year was actually my first time attending the annual conference.

A highlight of the conference was reconnecting with old friends from my Master’s and PhD days.
I’ve included some photos below—though not all are from last week, they do reflect some of the moments that made this return to Cologne so special.
