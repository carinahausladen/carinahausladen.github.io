I had the pleasure of presenting our paper, "Social Perception of Faces in a Vision-Language Model," at the Measuring Development 2024—AI, the Next Generation conference held at the World Bank in Washington, D.C.

The conference featured a diverse range of speakers from both academia and industry, making it an incredibly enriching experience.

After the conference, I had the chance to explore Washington, D.C., for the first time, and I was truly blown away by the wealth of museums and governmental monuments.

*A guided tour of the Capitol, the heart of democracy, was a particular highlight. Learning about the evolution of democracy in the U.S. was fascinating, and I highly recommend everyone take advantage of the free public tours available.*
