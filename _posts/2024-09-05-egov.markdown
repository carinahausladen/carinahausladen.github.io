I recently had the opportunity to present one of our papers at the EGOV-CeDEM-ePart conference: 
A Modular and Adaptive Experimentation Platform for Online Collective Decision Making. 

It was a great experience to share our research and get valuable feedback from experts in the field.

The conference itself was extremely stimulating, bringing together many practitioners and researchers working at the forefront of governance.

*Arenberg Castle in Leuven—originally built in the 16th century, now part of KU Leuven's campus. 
As I passed by, I heard beautiful piano music. I entered and found a piano in the middle of the hall, with someone casually playing. 
It was such a beautiful and unexpected moment.*


This was also my first visit to Belgium, and specifically to Leuven. 
What a fascinating city—with its beautiful architecture, rich history, and lively atmosphere.
